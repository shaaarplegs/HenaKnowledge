# Welcome to HenaKnowledge project.

This is an introduction to the website that will be developed.
HenaKnowledge is a platform in a university level so for example teachers admins and students can use it when other people outside
that scope can not access it.
That means this platform should Not let the students sign up themselves but admins do that to them.
This platform aims to let students share their experiences and posting them with a scoring system that evenually gives rewards to more active students.
That approach would help sharing knowledge and experience among students and would let them get rewards at the same time!
Since it is in an university level the students can access "Ask me" feature to one of the available teachers and then the teacher should give a respond
within certain amount of days (perhaps 3 days.)
In the future if this project succeeded, it would be very interesting to expand the scope to a country level where the students can interact with other students from different universities and different teachers.
